                I'm currently pursuing a dual degree at Virginia Tech in CS and Mathematics
                (it's as difficult as it sounds, I promise). I'm always looking for new things
                to learn, which is how I came across this entire new world of programming, Web Dev.
                The digital card you're looking at has been made using React, HTML, and CSS. Click
                on any of the given links to reach out to me, or check out my projects on GitHub. 
                I'll be adding projects I work on regularly!
